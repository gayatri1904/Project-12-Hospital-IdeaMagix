<b>Hospital-IdeaMagix</b>

Hospital-IdeaMagix is build using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. 

As a project received from IdeaMagix, I have developed the design of the website. I have created various HTML pages and then connected all of them together as a single web page using javascript. As per requirements I have only used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and pure Javascript. I have designed similar website like given to me as a attachment and have also made the website fully responsive for all type of devices. I have also made use of Carousel and Accordion and designed them as per your requirements. Here are screenshots of my project-

<b>Drawback</b>
Sorry due to time issue I cannot connnect it to database using Node Js. As yesterday my grandfather got expired so I was not able to work to the project. But still I have designed the website exactly similar to the reference. Please look for myÂ consideration.
